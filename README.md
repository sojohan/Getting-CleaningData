# Getting-CleaningData

This is repo for the course project Getting & Cleaning Data.

The assignment was to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This repo contains:
* run_analysis.R code for producing the final tidy data set steps 1-5
* Codebook.md a markdown document that the desribes the data, variables and the code
* This readme file

Steps for doing the analysis on your machine:
* Use getwd to get the location of your working directory
* Copy run_analysis.R to this directory
* The "UCI HAR Data" directory should be located here
